# Website

Personal website built using Hugo based on [charlola.mode](https://github.com/charlola/hugo-theme-charlolamode). Feel free to reuse it, it is very straightforward.

## Running locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull the submodule theme
   1. or: `git pull --recurse-submodules` if you want to pull your submodules to latest commits instead of the current commit the repo points to.
3. Run `hugo server` to start serving and building on changes.
